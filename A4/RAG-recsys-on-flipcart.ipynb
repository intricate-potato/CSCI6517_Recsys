Adding the price would also help to provide recomendation in terms of user budget.\n",

      "\n",
      "This product is highly relevant to the user's query as it is specifically designed for kitchen decor. The geometric pattern and wool material make it a great match for a kitchen rug. With a price of ₹3100.0, this product offers good value considering its high-quality materials and unique design.\n",
      "\n",

      "This product is similar to the first recommendation and also matches well with the user's query. It has a similar design and material as Product 1, making it another great option for kitchen decor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Options:** Firangi Cotton, Polyester Free Floor Mat Firangi Decorative TRD Fur Door Mat (Product 3)\n",
      "\n",
      "While this product doesn't exactly match the user's query, it could still be a good option for those looking for a more budget-friendly solution.

The price of ₹1449 is slightly higher than the first recommendation but still within your budget.\n",

While it's not specifically designed for footwear, the backpack's waterproof feature could be useful if you need to keep your gear dry in rainy conditions.\n",

The price of ₹599 might be slightly above your target, but considering the quality and features, it's still a good value proposition.\n",

      "GENERATED RECOMMENDATION:\n",
      "------------------------------\n",
      "Based on your query for a mid-to-premium ranged smartphone with long battery life, I've analyzed the products and prioritized those that excel in this feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Top Recommendation:** Product 1 - Robotel Battery - ROBO 017 BL 4C (Malti Color)\n",
      "\n",
      "While this product is technically a battery pack designed for Nokia mobile phones, its specifications are impressive. The 860 mAh lithium-ion battery offers high capacity and durability. What's noteworthy is the lack of memory effect, which means the battery will retain its charge even after multiple charge cycles.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of long battery life, this battery is an excellent choice. It's designed to provide extended usage without compromising performance or power consumption. The compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, adding to its overall value.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Runner-up:** None\n",
      "\n",
      "The other products don't quite meet the criteria for mid-to-premium ranged smartphones with long battery life. Product 2 is a router from Huawei, which doesn't relate to smartphones. Product 3 is a battery pack designed for Sony Xperia-T devices, but it's not a smartphone itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why this feature matters:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Long battery life is crucial in today's fast-paced world where we rely heavily on our smartphones. A device that can last throughout the day without needing frequent recharges provides a seamless user experience. This feature is especially important for mid-to-premium range devices, which often come with more powerful processors and higher-resolution displays.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Trade-offs and additional benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While this battery pack may not be designed specifically for a particular smartphone model, its high capacity and durability make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to extend the life of their device. Additionally, the compact design makes it easy to carry around, reducing the need for bulky power banks or chargers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on your query, I strongly recommend the Robotel Battery - ROBO 017 BL 4C (Malti Color) as a reliable and high-performance option for extending the life of your smartphone. Its exceptional battery life, durability, and compact design make it an excellent choice for anyone seeking long-term satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that this recommendation prioritizes quality over immediate savings. While budget options may be tempting, they often compromise on performance or lifespan. In the long run, investing in a high-quality battery pack like this one will provide a more satisfying user experience and reduce the need for frequent replacements.\n",

      "1. **Start with the blue eyelet door curtain**: Use this product as the focal point for your living room's design. Hang it above your sofa or sectional to draw attention and create a sense of grandeur.\n",
      "2. **Balance with white accents**: To balance out the boldness of the blue, incorporate white accents throughout the space. This can be achieved through furniture, decorative items, or even painting one wall white.\n",
      "3. **Add warm neutrals**: Introduce warm neutral tones like beige, cream, or light wood to create a sense of coziness and harmony in your living room.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Styling Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mix patterns and textures**: Combine the floral eyelet door curtain with other patterns and textures, such as a rug, throw pillows, or a statement piece of furniture.\n",
      "2. **Use lighting to enhance**: Hang pendant lights or table lamps with cream-colored shades to add warmth and highlight the blue eyelet door curtain.\n",
      "3. **Bring in greenery**: Add some green plants or a vase with fresh flowers to bring in natural elements and create a sense of serenity.\n",

    "\n",
    "If I were asked to evaluatr the recomender system for this assignment, I would have first tried evaluating the component i and ii toghether using retrival quality. I do not think seperate evaluation for encoder and retrival will be necessary because their collective task is to retrive relevant products. For evaluating this retrived products, we would generally consider different ranking metrics like `precision@k`, `recall@k`, `NDCG@K`, `MRR`. But the issue is we do not have any ground truth for such calculation in our flipcart dataset. For example, when our user asks for \"budget phone\", we do not know which retrieved products are actually good recommendations. So instead of using the metrics, we have to manually evaluate the retrival with our intuition for now (cosine similarity for the retrived product does give us slight idea of the retrival quality, but it is not something definitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I would check the generation quality manual checking first such as facutality of the generation. For example, when asking for a mobile, our retrivar gives a Huwaei router as 1st recomendation and if the generator is fooled by this and recomends it as a good phone, I would know that generation is not good. Also, I would look for coherence and relevance of the generator. So at the end of the day, we can see it comes down to human evaluation. Apart from that, there is an opportunity to use another LLM as a judge to automatically check for the quality of generation (Wang, 2024).\n",
